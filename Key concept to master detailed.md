## 🛡️ **IAM (Identity and Access Management)**  
**Description:** IAM manages identities, roles, and access policies to secure AWS resources. It's the cornerstone of managing access control.

**✅ Tips:**
- **IAM is global**: Users, groups, and roles are global, not tied to a specific region.
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Always grant the minimum permissions necessary.
- **IAM Policies**: Understand the differences between Managed Policies, Inline Policies, and Service Control Policies (SCP).
- **MFA**: Enable multi-factor authentication on root and critical IAM accounts.
- **IAM Roles vs IAM Users**: Use roles for AWS resources (e.g., EC2 to S3) instead of embedding IAM keys directly.

**🔗 Key Services:** IAM Users, Groups, Roles, Policies, Identity Federation.

**💡 Example:** For an e-commerce platform, you’d assign roles to your EC2 instances so they can access the necessary resources (like S3) without hardcoding credentials.

**📚 Resources:**
- [AWS IAM Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/)
- [AWS IAM Best Practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html)

## 🌐 **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**  
**Description:** VPC allows you to create a private network on AWS with complete control over IP addresses, subnets, and network connections. Essential for managing your network infrastructure.

**✅ Tips:**
- **Subnet Segregation**: Place databases in private subnets and web servers in public subnets to enhance security.
- **NACL vs Security Groups**: Security Groups are stateful (track connections), while NACLs are stateless.
- **VPC Peering**: Use VPC Peering to connect multiple VPCs. Be aware—no transitive routing (i.e., VPC-A can talk to VPC-B, but not VPC-C through VPC-B).
- **NAT Gateway**: Enable private instances to access the internet securely, while keeping them isolated from direct traffic.
- **VPC Flow Logs**: Activate logs to monitor network traffic and ensure compliance.

**🔗 Key Services:** Subnets, Security Groups, NACL, NAT Gateway, VPC Peering, VPC Flow Logs.

**💡 Example:** If you're building a multi-tier web application, place your application servers in a public subnet and your database in a private subnet to prevent direct access.

**📚 Resources:**
- [AWS VPC Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/)

- **Versioning**: Enable versioning to protect against accidental deletions.
- **Encryption**: Use SSE-S3, SSE-KMS, or Client-side Encryption for data security.
- **Object Lock**: Prevent accidental or malicious changes/deletions to critical data.
- **Lifecycle Policies**: Automate data transitions between storage classes for cost optimization (e.g., from Standard to Glacier).

**🔗 Key Services:** S3 Buckets, Versioning, Object Lock, Encryption, Lifecycle Policies, Access Control Lists (ACL).

**💡 Example:** For archived logs, you can set up a lifecycle policy that automatically moves them to Glacier after 30 days, saving on storage costs.
