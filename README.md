# 🚀 **My journey to passing the AWS Solutions Architect Associate certification – Tips and resources**

Obtaining the **AWS Solutions Architect Associate (SAA)** certification has been as rewarding as it was intense. It's not just a badge or another line on my resume; it's a **solid validation of my skills and a real leap forward in understanding AWS cloud architectures**. Today, I'd like to share my experience, the resources that helped me, the challenges I faced, and of course, some tips for those preparing for this challenge.

## 📚 **1. Resources & Preparation Methods**

### 🛠️ **Key Resources:**  
- **Review the official AWS exam guide** : Review it first so you know what to expect : [Link here.](https://d1.awsstatic.com/training-and-certification/docs-sa-assoc/AWS-Certified-Solutions-Architect-Associate_Exam-Guide.pdf)
- **Online Courses:** I personally used the famous **[Stéphane Maarek](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c03/?couponCode=NEWYEARCAREERFT)** course on Udemy. This one is a must with its clear explanations and practical examples.  
- **Mock Exams:** I used [TutorialsDojo](https://portal.tutorialsdojo.com/), they were the closest one from the real exam, 100% worth it !
- **AWS Official Documentation:** FAQs on key services (EC2, S3, RDS, IAM) are gold.
- **YouTube & Blogs:** Some videos explain complex architectures in a visual and simple way.  I liked this one from **[Be a better Dev-SNS/SQS/EventBridge/Kinesis](https://youtu.be/_bRTlb9b59Y?si=w_LncInY-YUn1JVL)**
- **The AWS Power Hour: Architecting Associate on twitch** by Aaron Hunter , John Marciniak and John Tuffin, [Link here.](https://pages.awscloud.com/GLOBAL-other-T2-Traincert-AWS-Power-Hour-Architecting-Associate-Season-5-2024-reg.html)
- Want some **fun** ? Try the [**AWS Card Clash**](https://aws.amazon.com/fr/training/digital/aws-card-clash/): It's a **FREE** online game about designing architecture with AWS services. 

### 🧠 **Learning Methods:**  
- **Active study:** I didn’t just watch videos. I directly applied each concept in practical labs : Used the tuto from Stephane Maarek + AWS Free Tier.  
- **Regular revision:** I revised my notes every night and consolidated weak points identified during mock exams.  
- **Exam mindset:** Understand the scenarios in the questions instead of memorizing answers : Explain yourself why this answer is correct ? Then read the correction ✅

### **[➡️ You can also check my AWS e-commerce migration architecture project to get an idea on how services work all together + you learn from my mistake!](https://github.com/Kzax01/AWS-E-commerce-migration-architecture)**


### 💡 I started this journey in September and was able to pass the certification in December, considering I had no real big experience in the cloud, It's definitely doable in 3-4 months. 
### Remember, consistancy is key. 🗝️

## 🔑 **2. Key concepts to master**  

Here are the areas you absolutely need to focus on:  
- **IAM (Identity and Access Management):** Managing permissions, policies, roles, and users.  
- **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud):** Subnets, Security Groups, NACL, peering, and VPN.  
- **S3 (Simple Storage Service):** Storage classes, security, encryption, and cross-region replication.  
- **Compute (EC2, Lambda, Auto Scaling):** Choosing instances, Auto Scaling strategy, Serverless with Lambda.  
- **Databases (RDS, DynamoDB):** Choosing the right database engine for each use case.  
- **Monitoring & Logging (CloudWatch, CloudTrail):** Incident detection and alert response.

Also, out of the **65 questions**, **15 are unscored** and are used for testing purposes by AWS.  

**The Security part is very important...**
## **[➞ I've made a full breakdown of each here](https://github.com/Kzax01/Cracking-the-AWS-SAA-Exam-Tips-Resources-and-My-Personal-Experience/blob/main/Detailed%20domains%20SAA.md). 🠔**

### 🕒 **Exam Duration:**

You will have **130 minutes** to complete the exam, but you can request an additional **30 minutes** while registering to the exam if you don't speak English. This can be very helpful since time flies quickly with the complex questions.

## 📝 **4. Final Exam Tips**

✅ **Understand the scenario:** Take time to carefully read each question. AWS loves questions based on real-life scenarios.  
✅ **Eliminate bad answers:** Sometimes eliminating 2 obvious choices makes it easier to pick the right one.  
✅ **Manage your time:** Some questions are long, but don’t get stuck. Move on and come back later.  
✅ **Use AWS tools:** Be comfortable with the most common services and their specific use cases.  
✅ **Stay calm:** Pressure can work against you. Breathe, re-read, and trust your knowledge.

## 🤔 **5. My post-certification thoughts**

When I received the email confirming my success, it was a mix of **relief, pride, and a bit of surprise**. It wasn’t just the certification that mattered, but the **entire journey** that got me here. Every night spent on a lab, every failure on a mock exam, every moment of doubt 
– *it was all part of the learning process*.  

This certification not only gave me technical skills but also **a real confidence** to tackle complex cloud projects.  

---

## ⚠️ **6. My mistakes and how to avoid them**

1️⃣ **Neglecting certain topics at first:** I underestimated the importance of **API Gateway** and some monitoring services. **Tip: Don’t leave any gaps.**  
2️⃣ **Focusing too much on mock exams:** Mock exams are useful, but don’t replace practical labs.  
3️⃣ **Accumulating fatigue:** I pushed too hard at times, which exhausted me. **Tip: Plan breaks and stick to them.**  
4️⃣ **Not asking enough questions:** Join forums or study groups to exchange and clarify doubts.

## 🌟 **7. What’s next?**

This certification is an important step, but not the final goal. Next step: **Terraform and AWS Security Specialty.** Each new skill will build an even stronger foundation for my future ambitions.  

---

## 💬 **8. Final word?**

Preparing for an AWS certification is not a straight line. It's a journey full of challenges, doubts, but also incredible successes. If you’re in the middle of it, **don’t give up**. Every hour invested, every question understood, brings you closer to your goal.  

And most importantly: **Celebrate your victories, big or small.**
